The file /my-custom-theme/my-custom-theme/screenshot.png is an image file that represents the theme in the WordPress admin area. Since I cannot generate image files directly, you will need to create or provide an appropriate image for this file. 

Please ensure that the image is named "screenshot.png" and is placed in the specified directory.
